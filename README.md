# RoomieMatch

RoomieMatch is an innovative app designed to help college students find the perfect roommates through a Tinder-like matching system. Developed using React and Firebase, this app features user profiles, swipeable cards, advanced filtering options, and a real-time chat functionality. RoomieMatch was created in 36 hours during the hackathon HackIllinois by me and two friends (@GoyalIshaan and @sh-crypto)

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Create and customize your profile to showcase your interests, preferences, and living habits.
- **Swipeable Cards**: Browse through potential roommates by swiping left to pass or right to connect.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Use filters to narrow down search results based on specific criteria such as major, interests, and living habits.
- **Live Chat**: Connect and chat with matched roommates in real-time to get to know each other better.
